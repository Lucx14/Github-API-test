#### Github API test

### Test requirements

Build a web or command line app, which should allow users to enter an arbitrary Github username, and be presented with a best guess of the Github user's favourite programming language.
This can be computed by using the Github API to fetch all of the user's public Github repos, each of which includes the name of the dominant language for the repository.
You may use any programming language, framework or library.

### Process

### User stories

```

I want to be able to enter a username and see the favourite language of the Github user.
```

### Using the app
